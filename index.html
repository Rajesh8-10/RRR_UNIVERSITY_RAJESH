            <p>Filmmaking (film production) is the process by which a motion picture is produced. Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete stages, starting with an initial story, idea, or commission. It then continues through screenwriting, casting, pre-production, shooting, sound recording, post-production, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and an exhibition. Filmmaking occurs in a variety of economic, social, and political contexts around the world. It uses a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques.</p>

                  <P>The development stage contains both general and specific components.Each film studio has a yearly retreat where their top creative executives meet and interact on a variety of areas and topics they wish to explore through collaborations with producers and screenwriters,and then ultimately,directors,actors,and actresses.They choose trending topics from the media and real life,as well as many other sources,to determine their yearly agenda.For example,in a year when action is popular,they may wish to explore that topic in one or more movies.Sometimes,they purchase the rights to articles,bestselling novels,plays,the remaking of older films,stories with some basis in real life through a person or event,a video game,fairy tale,comic book,graphic novel.Likewise,research through surveys may inform their decisions.They may have had Blockbusters from their previous year and wish to explore a sequel.They will additionally acquire a completed and independently financed and produced film.Such notable examples are "Little Miss Sunshine" and "The English Patient" as well as "Roma"."In my decade working as a writer,I knew of only a few that were sold and fewer that made it to the screen,"relays writer-director-professor Wayne Powers (The Italian Job).Alan Watt,writer-director and Founder of The LA Writer's Lab,confirmed that completed original screenplays,referred to as "specs",make big news when they sell,but these make up a very small portion of movies that are ultimately given the green light to be produced by the president of a studio.Filmmaking also takes place outside of the mainstream and is commonly called independent filmmaking.</P>
